            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="marg-bottom">I grew up in the Midwest, has lived on both coasts of the U.S. and has traveled
                extensively across the
                globe, which she attributes to her early curiosity and later passion for the many cuisines she’s
                encountered. Before earning her degree in culinary arts from a Le Cordon Bleu school in Portland, OR she
                spent a decade working in the footwear industry for both Adidas and Nike. Since coming into the culinary
                world she has owned and operated a ghost kitchen in the Pacific Northwest and later earned her degree as
                a holistic health coach. </p>
